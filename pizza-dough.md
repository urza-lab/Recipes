Inspired by [Vito Iacopelli](https://www.youtube.com/@vitoiacopelli), [Teichners Pizza Palace](https://www.youtube.com/@Teichners_Pizza_Palace) and [Einfach Backen - Marcel Paa](https://www.youtube.com/@marcelpaa)

## Tools
* Kitchen Machine

## Ingredients
For 3 Pizza's
* 500g Pizza Flour (Type 00) - I use [Caputo](https://www.mulinocaputo.it/de/ricette/la-pizza-napoletana/)
* Some Semola - I use [Caputo](https://www.mulinocaputo.it/de/produzieren/Grie%C3%9F/)
* Yeast (7g fresh or 1.7g dry - I use [Caputo](https://www.mulinocaputo.it/en/products/active-dry-yeast/)
* Teaspoon Honey
* 15g Salt
* 320ml Cold Water

## Dough
### Base (2 hours, 30 minutes active)
1. Put Fluor into Kitchen Machine Bowl. If using dry Yeast: Mix 1.7g into Fluor directly
2. Dissolve Teaspoon of Honey in 320ml water. If using fresh Yeast: Add 7g and mix
3. Mix the Dough in the Kitchen Machine for 10 - 15 minutes while adding water **step by step** - *this allows the dough to absorb the water* - and add 15g Salt after having all water added
5. Remove dough from the bowl to the counter and [fold it](https://youtu.be/hxMMT9NrGcc?si=x9VhxrxLXqaJqqjt&t=265) 20 times while keeping top side on top - *this makes the dough less sticky and adds air into it*
6. Form the dough to a big ball by applying a [funnel-like form](https://youtu.be/hxMMT9NrGcc?si=1WdL95Xa-JzTvFWj&t=289) with your hands around the bottowm of the dough and twisting it
7. Cover the dough with a bit of olive oil, put the mixing bowl upside down on it and let it rest for an hour

### Pizza balls 
1. Remove mixing bowl from dough, slice it into three even parts - *these will be your Pizza balls*
2. Keep top of the parts on top, while folding dough under the part to form a ball - *you can also [flip the ball and fold it upwards](https://youtu.be/hxMMT9NrGcc?si=geojQPr5197EfTK7&t=361), just make sure to turn it around again before the next step*
3. [Form a cave](https://youtu.be/hxMMT9NrGcc?si=oZ4Ncbr068rG_Z-m&t=380) with your hands over and around the Pizza ball, pull the ball towards you, lift the ball while rotating it a bit and repeat - *this closes the ball underneath*
4. Repeat for every Pizza ball
5. Cover Pizza balls with oil
6. Put into fridge overnight **OR** put the flipped mixing bowl on them to rest another 1-2 hours
7. Pre-heat your oven to the maximum - *for conventional household ovens, use its Pizza (convection + lower Rod) or convection mode*
8. Take a tupper box and fill some semola into it
9. Remove mixing bowl from Pizza balls, put semola on the connections between the balls and separate them from each other
10. Add Pizza ball into semola tupper box, turn it to have both sides covered with Semola
11. Follow [Mr. Teichner's instructions](https://youtu.be/hxMMT9NrGcc?si=JFkn1DhSCmJXnb72&t=539) to form your Pizza ball to a Pizza
12. Put the stuff you like on to it
13. Put the Pizza in your oven, check every now and then to find about the sweet spot. 275Â°C is usually ready after 6-8 minutes
14. Enjoy
